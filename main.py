#🚦 OK here is what you need to do to run this:
    #🚦 0. Import what you need (keep in mind that you need to install python 3.9 and select it as the python interpreter. And some other stuff that is not just a simple pip install...)
    #🚦 1. Pick Mage starting class and create a new character. Equip left hand staff, right hand sword, only one spell, and only the healing flasks.
    #🚦 2. Start the game and load the character (and walk to a fog gate of the boss you want to fight)
    #🚦 3. Put the game in the top left corner of the screen and make it windowed 1920x1080 (its not to the very left of the screen. There is a small gap. You can render the screenshot to make sure its positioned correctly)
    #🚦 4. Run train.py 
    #🚦 5. The training will start in the reset function...
    #🚦 5.1 The reset function looks for a loading screen and resets the game by walking back to the boss. (It will also end after 20seconds of not seeing a loading screen)
    #🚦 5.2 When the reset function is done, the agent will take over and start taking actions
    #🚦 5.3 The step function will repeat and take actions until it is determined to be done (the agent dies, the boss dies, or the fight takes more than 10minutes)
    #🚦 6 train.py will then save the model and start the next episode (the next reset)

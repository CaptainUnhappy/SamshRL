hmm... so...
Elden Ring Ai that integrated with Twitch chat. That's a good idea. I like it. But what do we need to do to make it happen?

✔️❌🚧

🚧An Ai that plays Elden Ring
    ✔️Fight bosses
    ❌Fight non boss enemies
    ❌Flee from non boss enemies
    ❌Fight pvp players
    ❌Explore the world

🚧Integration with Twitch chat
    ❌chat can equip items/spells on the Ai
    🚧Chat can perform actions (movement, dodge, attack, block, jump attack, roll catch attack, heal, weapon art, dual wield, crouch, etc)
    ❌Chat can perform emotes (dance, cheer, bow, etc)
    ❌Chat can respec the Ai stats completely
    ❌Chat can fast travel
    ❌Long distance movement in open world
    ❌Join pvp matches (start a queue)
    ❌Change boss (every 10 tries we do a poll to see what boss we should fight another boss from the to do list)



Twitch fun integration

✔️Grabbing the messages and deciding what function to call
    ❌use the messages we already have if that works or grab messages in a different way. Maybe because we will be using channel points the messages might not work
    ✔️ Twitch dosnt allow small channels to use channel points so we need to use normal chat messages









REFACTORING

❌Adjust the code for pvp
❌Add running attacks and some other actions
❌Add a debug mode for the ai program (like rendering the ai's vision and stuff)
❌Refactor the code
❌Improve the documentation
❌Make a video explaining how the ai works
❌Make a main file that runs the ai
